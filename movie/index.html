                    <p>
                        An unnamed CIA agent—"The Protagonist"—participates in an undercover operation at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev">Kiev</a> opera house. 
                        He is aided by a masked soldier with a distinctive trinket, who appears to "un-fire" a bullet through a 
                        hostile gunman. After rescuing an exposed spy and seizing a strange artifact, the Protagonist is captured 
                        by Russian mercenaries. He endures torture before consuming a cyanide pill. He later awakens to learn 
                        the pill was fake; his team has been killed and the artifact lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Protagonist learns that he is now employed by a secret organization called "Tenet," 
                        whose mission involves the human race's survival. He is directed to Barbara, a scientist studying 
                        bullets with "inverted" entropy which allows them to move backwards through time. She believes they 
                        are manufactured in the future, and there exists a weapon that can wipe out the past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Protagonist traces the bullet cartridges to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Mumbai</a>-based arms dealer Priya Singh. Assisted by a 
                        local contact named Neil, he confronts Priya, who turns out to be a member of Tenet. Her cartridges 
                        were purchased and inverted by Andrei Sator, a Russian oligarch originating from Stalsk-12, a former 
                        Soviet closed city, and who can apparently communicate with the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Protagonist approaches Sator's estranged wife Kat, an art appraiser who unknowingly sold Sator a 
                        forged Goya drawing. Kat reveals that Sator uses the drawing to keep her under his control. To enlist 
                        Kat's help, the Protagonist plots to steal the drawing from Freeport, a facility within Oslo Airport. 
                        Inside Freeport, they find a machine (later referred to as "Turnstile") from which two masked men emerge; 
                        the inverted one attacks the Protagonist, while Neil chases after the normal one. Neil prevents the 
                        Protagonist from killing the inverted man, adding that he "took care" of the other one. Priya explains 
                        that Turnstile is developed in the future and can invert the entropy of objects and people, and that 
                        the two masked men were the same person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Amalfi Coast, believing the drawing was destroyed, Kat introduces the Protagonist to Sator, 
                        only to learn later that the drawing is still intact. The three go on a boating trip, during which 
                        Kat attempts to drown Sator, but the Protagonist saves him. Posing as a freelancer, he offers to help 
                        Sator retrieve a case of Plutonium-241.
